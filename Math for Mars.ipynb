    "Mars is a primary destination for space travel today as it is a candidate for a colony in our solar system. It's relatively close to Earth, has enough sunlight (for growing plants), and has a reasonable amount of gravity [1]. NASA has sent rovers to Mars and plans to send people to Mars after the Moon [2]. The private company SpaceX seeks to reduce costs on rockets, and oneday make humans interplanetary [1]. In this notebook, I'll explore the math related to safely launching a rocket to Mars. I'll use python code to assist in computations."
